            A warrant canary is a method by which a communications service
            provider reveals that it has been served with a secret government
            subpoena, despite legal prohibitions against acknowledging the
            existence of the subpoena. It publishes a regular transparency
            report (the "canary") declaring that it has not received any such
            subpoenas; if the report stops being published, users are left to
            assume they have received such a subpoena.
        </p>

        <p>As of 2024-05-16, I declare the following:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Up until now, in the lifespan of ari.lt, we have not received
                nor complied with any government agency orders to disclose user
                data hosted on our servers.
            </li>
            <li>
                No warrants, subpoenas, or other government notices have been
                served to us that compels us to disclose any confidential
                information connected with our services, inclusive of the
                sharing of the encryption keys.
            </li>
            <li>
                There have been no seizures or non-voluntary physical visits or
                intrusions by law enforcement or government officials which
                would affect the confidentiality of user data or interfere with
                our services.
            </li>
            <li>
                We have not been subject to any gag orders which would prevent
                us from stating that we have received legal process seeking
                access to user data, nor have we been forced to install any
                government surveillance tools onto our systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                If this message is not updated or removed it means that all the
                above statements continue to be true.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            We are dedicated to safeguarding the digital privacy and rights of
            our users. If any of the above points is no longer true, we will
            take down this message. While we cannot legally comment on the
            received orders as directed by a court, the removal of this warrant
            canary would indicate to users that a form of legal process has been
            served.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note: This warrant canary carries legitimation only up until the
            unpublication of the statement or if it hasn't been updated in more
            than <b>3 months</b>. A removal of this statement would be indicative of
            instant expiry. The statements made do not include any personal
            qualities of predictability and do not carry any future
            implications.
        </p>
